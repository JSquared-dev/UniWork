This project is a source for all of my work at university. It contains all of my coursework elements as well as a few extra things here and there. It is provided as-is, with the hope it is helpful to somebody out there in the wild yonder. In the mean-time, it's just a global repo for getting things to and from university without too much trouble.

Decoding folder names

The folders in the root directory are separated into each year at university, while each subfolder relates to a specific module I have taken/am taking in that year. See the README in each year's directory to see what the folder names mean.
